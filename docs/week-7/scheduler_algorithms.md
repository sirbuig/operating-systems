# CPU Scheduler Algorithms

FCSF, SJF, SRT, RR -> I don't have a stroke.

:::tip summary
Here we will see how those algorithms work :
- First come, First-Served Scheduling (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First Scheduling non-preemptive (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First Scheduling (SRT)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling
- Priority Scheduling + Round Robin
